<font color="black" size="4"> About the Workshop </font> In conjunction with [<font color="darkblue">ACM SenSys 2018</font>](http://sensys.acm.org/2018/)

Sensing technologies are being widely used in environments such as smart home, smart building, vehicular network, etc. Information collected from networked sensor systems are valuable if shared and tracked correctly. However, todayâ€™s sensing-cloud paradigm does not genetically support trust management and privacy preservation; it also does not encourage information sharing in multi-stakeholder settings through incentives and payment mechanisms. The emerging blockchain and other distributed ledger technologies offer a possibility to 1) ensure data protection, 2) monetize information exchange, and 3) reduce sharing and maintenance costs.

<font color="black" size="4"> Call for Papers </font> 

We solicit high quality position papers and research papers that address opportunities and challenges at the intersection of networked sensing/IoT and blockchain. We aim to set up a stage for industry and academia to share wins and lessons combining both disciplines. We welcome contributions to all relevant research on application, system, network and security. 

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
  <font size="2.75">
  * Applications of blockchain in sensing and IoT environments<br/>
  * New protocols and consensus algorithms providing fault-tolerance for sensing and IoT systems<br/>
  * Sensor data-tampering protection using blockchain based systems<br/>
  * Incentives and reward mechanisms for sharing sensing data<br/>
  * Decentralized sensing data sharing and storage<br/>
  * Smart contract design and implementation<br/>
  * Resource optimization on compute, storage, energy and network<br/>
  * Solutions to performance and scalability issues<br/>

<font color="black" size="4"> Submission Guidelines </font> 

Submissions must be full papers, at most 6 pages, including figures, tables and references, in two-column format, using a minimum of 10-pt font. Submitted papers must not be under review or published elsewhere. The review of all papers will follow the general single-blind policy. We require each to be in Adobe Portable Document Format (PDF) with [<font color="darkblue">ACM templates</font>](https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template) ([<font color="darkblue">submit notes</font>](http://sensys.acm.org/2018/resources/documents/HowTo.pdf)) and submitted through the [submission site](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=bcns2018). Accepted submissions will be available in the ACM digital library on the first day of the conference.
